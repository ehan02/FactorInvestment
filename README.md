Factor-Based Investment Analysis

Project Overview
This project is designed to implement factor-based investment strategies using Python. It utilizes various financial factors such as value, momentum, quality, and volatility to select stocks and construct portfolios that aim to outperform the market. By analyzing historical data, the project identifies patterns and relationships between different factors and stock returns to make informed investment decisions.

Features
Data Collection: Scripts to fetch historical stock prices, company fundamentals, and macroeconomic indicators from various sources.
Factor Research: Implementation of common financial factors and the ability to design custom factors.
Portfolio Construction: Tools to construct and optimize portfolios based on factor scores and user-defined constraints
Rebalancing: Includes a time-based rebalancing script that automatically adjusts portfolio allocations at predetermined intervals to maintain desired factor weightings.
